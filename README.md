# Car Rim - Autodesk Inventor  

This project consists of modeling a **car rim** in 3D using **Autodesk Inventor**. The model was created using various parametric design tools.  

## Autodesk Inventor Tools Used  

- **Sketch** → Creating the initial 2D rim contour.  
- **Revolve** → Generating the basic rim shape by rotating a 2D profile around an axis.  
- **Extrude** → Adding and removing material to shape the final design.  
- **Fillet** → Applying fillets to smooth edges and improve aesthetics.  
- **Pattern (Circular & Rectangular)** → Copying repetitive elements such as rim spokes.  
- **Chamfer** → Adding chamfers to edges for a realistic and functional look.  
- **Shell** → Hollowing out the model to reduce weight and optimize structure.  

## Project File  

- **3D Model:** `Stergarel_Elisabeta_Elena_421C.ipt`
